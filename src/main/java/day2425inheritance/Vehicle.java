    1)Every class except from "Object Class" has parent class
    2) Object Class is the "Parent Class" of all Classes in Java.
    3) Just "Object Class" does not have any "Parent Class" in Java.
    4) Java executes constructors from top to bottom in inheritance
    5) To be able to execute constructors from top to bottom Java goes to the Object Class first by the help of "super()"
    6) super() is for calling constructor from the first level "parent class".
    7) "super()" is located by Java into every constructor but it invisible to us.
    8) If you want to make it visible, you can type it explicitly
    9) When you type "super()" explicitly you have to type it into the first line inside the constructor body.

    10)"this()" is for calling constructors from the class itself
    11)When you type "this()", you have to type it in the first line of constructor body.
    12) "this()" and "super()" cannot be used in the same constructor together, because if you put anyone of them in the
    first line the other one cannot be put in the first line
